## What?

Collection of links and ideas about the hiring process in the IT industry and related subjects, like, education.

I collect those resources for my small research.

## Why?

The current recruiting process in IT is a mess.

There are no standardized definitions of positions. The same position in different companies can assume two different skill sets.

There is no single approach to the hiring process, so each time this is a surprise for the candidate. All ask different questions from "dog or cat" to "rebalance red-black tree on the whiteboard".

Because the hiring process is so chaotic often happens that decision is random or biased. Often there is no feedback, so no hope for improving the situation.

Recruiters struggle to understand if a person is a good fit for the position, for the team. The risk for them is that one bad hire can "destroy" the team. It is easy to hire someone and harder to fire.

Applicants struggle because the interview is a stressful process. And often they don't get an explanation of why they were rejected.

Both sides lose a lot of time.

It doesn't have to be that way. In my opinion, the hiring process is about finding a match. The company wants to find the person who will fit into the team and will get the job done. The applicant wants to find a good team and place where they will get compensated for the work.

There are a lot of good people. There are a lot of good companies. Can't we make it easier for everybody?

**Note**: There are bad actors e.g. people who don't care about their job or team (toxic people) or companies who do not care about their workers and simply want to extract as much as possible value and don't want to build a healthy relationship. I'm talking about the ideal situation. Can we improve the process for good actors?

## Links

## About interviewing

Structured approach:

> Interviews take a lot of time and do not test candidates in real conditions.
>
> This is why in @evilmartians we use “interview by email”. We send an email with questions and give candidates 24 hours to answer. It’s still good to test communication skills but much more comfortable.
>
> -- [@sitnikcode](https://twitter.com/sitnikcode/status/1052167529081294848?s=20)

> I think hiring now is one of the most significant problems in IT.
>
> Current HR practices are bad not only for candidates but for the company too. Because they cut many good developers.
>
> I think these 3 rules can improve your hiring process:
> HR rule 1: Use objective criteria. Intuition mostly hides unconscious discrimination. The reason should be “CSS without component isolation”, “the previous website has no retina support”, or “think that 3D hack enables GPU”, not “he/she will not fit us”.
> HR rule 2: always answer to resume. And describe the real reason, why the candidate didn’t pass this step. With rule 1 you will have good reasons.
> HR rule 3: take real problem from your work for interview and tests. Don’t try to create some tricky question for a filter.

Diversity:
