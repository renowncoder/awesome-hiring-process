## What?

Collection of links and ideas about the hiring process in the IT industry and related subjects, like, education.

I collect those resources for my small research.

## Why?

The current recruiting process in IT is a mess.

There are no standardized definitions of positions. The same position in different companies can assume two different skill sets.

There is no single approach to the hiring process, so each time this is a surprise for the candidate. All ask different questions from "dog or cat" to "rebalance red-black tree on the whiteboard".

Because the hiring process is so chaotic often happens that decision is random or biased. Often there is no feedback, so no hope for improving the situation.

Recruiters struggle to understand if a person is a good fit for the position, for the team. The risk for them is that one bad hire can "destroy" the team. It is easy to hire someone and harder to fire.

Applicants struggle because the interview is a stressful process. And often they don't get an explanation of why they were rejected.

Both sides lose a lot of time.

It doesn't have to be that way. In my opinion, the hiring process is about finding a match. The company wants to find the person who will fit into the team and will get the job done. The applicant wants to find a good team and place where they will get compensated for the work.

There are a lot of good people. There are a lot of good companies. Can't we make it easier for everybody?

**Note**: There are bad actors e.g. people who don't care about their job or team (toxic people) or companies who do not care about their workers and simply want to extract as much as possible value and don't want to build a healthy relationship. I'm talking about the ideal situation. Can we improve the process for good actors?

## Links

### About bootcamps

> But in order to get people into tech jobs, they need to be educated properly.
>
> Unfortunately, many bootcamps are doing a terrible job. Instead of helping students, they are actively harming them, and in some cases, ruining lives.
>
> So, someone needs to talk about this.

## About interviewing

> "Heard of a cool tech-bro-weeding interview technique the other day. A male and female engineer conduct the interview session together. If, when the female engineer asks the candidate a question, he directs his answer to the male engineer,then he's out.They said it happens a lot"
